The National Science Foundation (NSF) maintains a public facing API of the award database that is marginally less painful to use than the web-based GUI interface.

This repo contains an API Wrapper for that API. Maybe someday I'll make it into a package.

Additionally, it contains a script that combines NSF's API data and USASpending Data for an analysis of the administratively terminated awards processed in FY25.
